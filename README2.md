1. Finalize Smart Contracts: Ensure all contracts are fully tested, audited, and verified on Etherscan.
2. Frontend Build & Hosting:
3. Build your React app for production.
4. Host it on a global CDN (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3+CloudFront, or GitHub Pages).
5. Environment Variables: Make sure your frontend uses the correct, production contract addresses and ABIs.
6. Wallet Integration: Ensure MetaMask and other wallet support is smooth for users worldwide.
7. Backend/API (if needed): Deploy any backend services (e.g., for analytics, off-chain data, or notifications) to a scalable cloud provider.
8. Domain & SSL: Register a domain and set up HTTPS.
9. Monitoring & Analytics: Add error tracking (e.g., Sentry) and usage analytics.
10. Documentation & Support: Publish user guides, FAQs, and provide a support channel.
11. Legal & Compliance: Ensure you meet legal requirements for your target regions (privacy, KYC/AML, etc.).
12. Marketing & Community: Announce your launch, engage users, and build a community.

1. Smart Contracts
 Finalize all contract code and comments.
 Write and pass comprehensive unit and integration tests.
 Perform security audits (manual or with tools like MythX, Slither).
 Deploy contracts to the mainnet (or target chain).
 Verify contracts on Etherscan (or equivalent explorer).
 Record and back up all deployed addresses and ABIs.
2. Frontend (React App)
 Update .env and config files with mainnet contract addresses and ABIs.
 Test wallet connections (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) on mainnet.
 Build the app for production (npm run build or equivalent).
 Optimize for performance (code splitting, image optimization, etc.).
 Ensure mobile and cross-browser compatibility.
 Add error handling and user feedback for failed transactions.
3. Hosting & Domain
 Choose a global hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, etc.).
 Deploy the production build.
 Register a custom domain.
 Set up HTTPS/SSL for secure access.
 Configure CDN for fast global delivery.
4. Backend/API (if needed)
 Deploy any required backend services (Node.js, Python, etc.).
 Secure APIs (authentication, rate limiting).
 Ensure scalability and uptime monitoring.
5. Monitoring & Analytics
 Integrate error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.).
 Add usage analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.).
 Set up uptime and performance monitoring.
6. Documentation & Support
 Write user guides and FAQs.
 Document smart contract interfaces (e.g., with Natspec).
 Provide a support email or chat channel.
 Prepare a changelog and update policy.
7. Legal & Compliance
 Review privacy policy and terms of service.
 Ensure compliance with KYC/AML if required.
 Check for regional restrictions or licensing needs.
8. Marketing & Community
 Announce launch on social media and relevant forums.
 Set up a community channel (Discord, Telegram, etc.).
 Prepare press releases or blog posts.
 Collect and act on user feedback.
9. Maintenance & Updates
 Plan for regular updates and bug fixes.
 Monitor for security vulnerabilities.
 Set up a process for emergency contract upgrades (if possible).
